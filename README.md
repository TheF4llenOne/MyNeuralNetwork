## Neural Network from Scratch
### Overview

This project implements a neural network from the ground up, providing an in-depth understanding of how neural networks operate. The model includes basic layers such as dense layers, activation functions, and a loss function, enabling training on the Fashion MNIST dataset. Future updates will incorporate convolutional layers to enhance image processing capabilities.
### Features

- Custom Neural Network Implementation: Built from scratch, providing full control over the architecture and training process.
- Layer Types: Includes dense layers, activation functions (ReLU and Softmax), and a categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- Training on Fashion MNIST: The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of clothing items.
- Future Development: Plans to integrate convolutional layers to improve the model's performance on image classification tasks.
